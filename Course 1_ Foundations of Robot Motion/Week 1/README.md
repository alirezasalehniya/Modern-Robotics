## Foundations of Robot Motion

Chapters 2 and 3: The study of representation on position, velocities and forces in three-dimensional space.

The most fountametal question you can ask about a robot is "Where is it?"
The answer of this question is the robot's configuraiton

- Configuration: A specification of the position of all points of a robot
- C-Sapce: The space of all configurations
- Degrees of Freedoms (DOF): The dimension of the C-Space
- DOF = &#931; (freedoms of points) - # of independent constraints
