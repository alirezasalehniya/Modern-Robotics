## Lecture Comprehension, Degrees of Freedom of a Robot (Chapter 2.2)

### Question 1:

Consider a joint between two rigid bodies. Each rigid body has m degrees of freedom (m=3 for a planar rigid body and m=6 for a spatial rigid body) in the absence of any constraints. The joint has f degrees of freedom (e.g., f=1 for a revolute joint or f=3 for a spherical joint). How many constraints does the joint place on the motion of one rigid body relative to the other?  Write your answer as a mathematical expression in terms of m and f.<br>
Answer:  ${\color{red}m-f}$

### Question 2:

Consider a mechanism consisting of three spatial rigid bodies (including ground, N=4) and four joints: one revolute, one prismatic, one universal, and one spherical. According to Grubler's formula, how many degrees of freedom does the mechanism have?<br>
Answer: ${\color{red}1}$

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Question 3:

A mechanism that is incapable of motion has zero degrees of freedom. In some circumstances, Grubler's formula indicates that the number of degrees of freedom of a mechanism is negative. How should that result be interpreted?<br>
&#10003; The constraints implied by the joints must not be independent.<br>
&#10007; The number of joints, the degrees of freedom of those joints, or the number of rigid bodies must have been counted incorrectly.<br>
