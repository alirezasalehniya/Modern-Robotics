## Lecture Comprehension, Configuration Space Topology (Chapter 2.3.1)

### Question 1:
To deform one n-dimensional space into another topologically equivalent space, which operations are you allowed to use?  Select all that apply.<br>
&#10003; Stretching<br>
&#10007; Cutting<br>
&#10007; Gluing<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Question 2:
True or false?  An n-dimensional space can be topologically equivalent to an m-dimensional space, where m≠n.<br>
&#10007; True<br>
&#10003; False<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Stretching: This operation involves changing the sizes or proportions of objects in the space while preserving their connectivity. Stretching can be used to deform one space into another without cutting or gluing.

- Cutting: This operation, as explicitly stated in the passage, is not allowed. Cutting would introduce discontinuities or disconnected components, altering the topology of the space.

- Gluing: This operation, as also mentioned in the passage, is not allowed. Gluing involves joining different parts of the space together, which would result in a change in topology.

So, to deform one n-dimensional space into another topologically equivalent space, stretching is the primary operation used. Cutting and gluing are explicitly excluded from the allowed operations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deforming a space by stretching alone cannot change its dimension. The dimension of a space is an intrinsic property that remains constant throughout deformations.

Therefore, if two spaces have different dimensions, they cannot be topologically equivalent. Two spaces are considered topologically equivalent if and only if they have the same dimension. So, the statement "An n-dimensional space can be topologically equivalent to an m-dimensional space, where m ≠ n" is false. The dimension of the spaces must be the same for them to be topologically equivalent.
