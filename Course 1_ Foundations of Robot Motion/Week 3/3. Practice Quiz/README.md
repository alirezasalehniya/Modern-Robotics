## Lecture Comprehension, Rotation Matrices (Chapter 3.2.1, Part 2 of 2)

### Question 1:
Which of the following is equivalent to R_ac, the representation of the orientation of the {c} frame relative to the {a} frame? Select all that apply.<br>
&#10003; ${\color{red}R_ab.R_bc}$ <br>
&#10003; ${\color{red}R_ab.((R_bc)^T)}$ <br>
&#10003; ${\color{red}[((R_bc)^T).((R_ab)^T)]^T}$ <br>
&#10003; ${\color{red}R_ad.R_db.R_bc}$ <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Question 2:
The matrix:

represents the orientation R_sa of a frame {a} that has been achieved by rotating the {s} frame by 90 degrees about its -axis. Now, given a matrix R_xb representing the orientation of {b} relative to {s}, which of the following represents the orientation of a frame (relative to {s}) that was initially aligned with {b}, but then rotated about the {b}-frame's x-axis by 90 degrees?<br>
&#10003; ${\color{red}R_sb.R}$ <br>
&#10007; R.R_sb <br>

### Question 3:
The matrix:

represents the orientation R_sa of a frame {a} that has been achieved by rotating the {s} frame by 90 degrees about its x-axis. Now, given a matrix R_sb representing the orientation of {b} relative to {s}, which of the following represents the orientation of a frame (relative to {s}) that was initially aligned with {b}, but then rotated about the {s}-frame's x-axis by 90 degrees?<br>
&#10007; (R<sub>sb</sub>)<br>
&#10003; ${\color{red}R.R_sb}$ <br>
