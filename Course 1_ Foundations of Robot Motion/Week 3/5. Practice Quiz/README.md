## Lecture Comprehension, Exponential Coordinates of Rotation (Chapter 3.2.3, Part 1 of 2)

### Question 1:
The orientation of a frame {d} relative to a frame {c} can be represented by a unit rotation axis --- and the distance θ rotated about the axis. If we rotate the frame {c} by θ about the axis ---  expressed in the {c} frame, we end up at {d}. The vector --- has 3 numbers and θ is 1 number, but we only need 3 numbers, the exponential coordinates ------, to represent {d} relative to {c}, because:<br>
&#10003; Though we use 3 numbers to represent ---- actually only represents a point in a 2-dimensional space, the 2-dimensional sphere of unit 3-vectors. <br>
&#10007; The choice of θ is not independent of ----. <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Question 2:
One reason we use 3x3 rotation matrices (an implicit representation) to represent orientation is because it is a good global representation: there is a unique orientation for each rotation matrix, and vice-versa, and there are no singularities in the representation. In what way does the 3-vector of exponential coordinates fail these conditions? Select all that apply. <br>
&#10003; There could be more than one set of exponential coordinates representing the same orientation.<br>
&#10007; Some orientations cannot be represented by exponential coordinates. <br>

### Question 3:
The vector linear differential equation ----, where x is a vector and B is a constant square matrix, is solved as ---, where the matrix exponential ---- is defined as:<br>
&#10003; the sum of an infinite series of matrices of the form (Bt)^0 + Bt + ... <br>
&#10007; the sum of an infinite series of matrices of the form Bt + Bt/2 + ... <br>
